# Project-4: Building A Django + React App


## Overview

The objective of this project was to develop a web application using React on the frontend with a Django REST Framework (DRF) backend connection via API calls utilizing Axios, the promise based HTTP client.  The engineer / developer chose to undertake the creation of an app that allowed users to track pantry items and other perishable foodstuffs with their user account's 'virtual' online pantry.  He also leveraged a 3rd party web API so that PantryApp users can obtain listings of nearby farmers markets where they might replenish their perishables.

## Main Application Process & Related Details

Your Pantry App (üçûyPaü•õ) allows its users to manage and track perishable goods along with other pantry foodstuffs.  Whether your items are in a dry goods cabinet, refrigerator or that bunker you've setup for the zombie apocalypse, yPa is the food storage tracking solution for you.  

After setting up a user profile (including a zip code), identifying your pantry / food storage locations; and, 'virtually' storing items within a designated location(s), the app's backend can make AJAX request to a 3rd party HTTP web API.  This enables the app to return a list of local Farmers Markets along with their approximate distances (in miles) from the users zip code.

Routings on the backend, utilizing Django REST framework, include: `/api/v1/userprofiles/`, `/api/v1/pantries/`, `/api/v1/items/`, and `/api/v1/markets/`.  Best practices were applied with respect to following F.I.R.S.T guidelines for React components (i.e., focused, independent, reusable, small & testable) and to defining _RESTful_ routes using HTTP protocal. Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) capability exists for all API models (Users, Pantries and Items). The primary frontend routes to the PostgresQL database are `/userslist`, `/pantries`, and `/items`. 

Finding a suitable web API provider, proved to be a challenge to successfully completing this project. In making a selection that satisfied the project's rubric, I initially identified potentially suitable API services providers based upon the level of documentation available.  The initial concept for a pantry app was partly inspired by the 3rd party web API offered by a large grocery store chain operator -- the attraction being the ability to show (get) locations based on a zip code.  However, the requirements of that web API were eventualy deemed too onerous for the app's endusers.  

As a 2nd alternative, the developer identified a nationwide, big-box retailer's open API offerings. While that specific option would have meet requirements, the provider had temporarily halted issuance of new API keys until 6/30/19 (beyond this project's due date).  After evaluating several other potential options, the developer finally settled upon the USDA's National Farmers Market Directory API.        


## Features

* Django app backend, utilizing Django Rest Framework 
* Single Page Application (SPA), client-side rendering of data via React to handle front-end UI  
* 3 model schemas - users, pantries & items
* Uses AJAX requests to create, read, udate and delete entities
* Backend makes AJAX requests to 3rd party HTTP web api


## Future Development

* Incorporate additional details specific to individual farmers market locations
* Add another web API to display nearby supermarket location in proximity to the user
* Include LatLong query parameters as the starting point for the 3rd party API
